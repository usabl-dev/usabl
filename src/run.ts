/**
 * `run(deps, config)` is the whole engine sequencer: guard, cover, scan, gate, maybe receipt.
 * It never decides a verdict. The gate does. This file only sequences injected I/O.
 *
 * Guard runs first. Diverged working-tree floor and waiver bytes are not parsed,
 * because a crash would fail open (exit 4) instead of blocking as approval_required.
 * Affected UI still scans so mixed policy PRs keep accessibility findings.
 *
 * Coverage mapping comes from the planner shared by tests and production code.
 * A local fallback mapper is forbidden because it could hide unmapped UI as idle.
 *
 * No hidden filesystem, git, or browser. Callers pass Deps (real or `makeFakeDeps`).
 * Sampling is forbidden: every affected surface is scanned, or we do not claim verified.
