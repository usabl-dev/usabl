/**
 * CheckRunner executes one screen scan and returns transcript stops, provider drafts, and coverage gaps.
 * It must never throw, never mint a verdict, and never drop a failed screen on the floor.
 * Transcript collection runs before providers because interaction probes can mutate focus order.
 *
 * A screen this run did not reach signed in is disclosed as a coverage gap and measured no
 * further. See providers/redirected.ts for the three rules, when each fires, and what they can
 * and cannot see.
