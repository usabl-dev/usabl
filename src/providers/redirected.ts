/**
 * Detects that a scan did not reach the screen it was asked for, signed in.
 *
 * The failure this closes, measured on a real login-gated application. The scan session expired.
 * usabl scanned what it got back under the requested screen ids, filed the sign-in page's barriers
 * as that screen's barriers, disclosed nothing, and told the gate that all twenty-nine accepted
 * barriers on those screens were resolved. The verdict came back red only because the page it
 * measured happened to carry barriers of its own. A clean one would have produced verified, with a
 * receipt, and a claim that the debt was paid.
 *
 * How that application actually behaves, measured. The browser never leaves the requested address.
 * The single page application renders a blank shell for over five seconds and then swaps a login
 * form in at the same URL: a heading, a text input, a password input, three focusable elements. A
 * scan that settles mid transition sees a partial page. So neither the address nor the password
 * field is reliable on its own here. What is reliable is the network: three of the page's own API
 * calls to identity endpoints answered 401 immediately. The same screen loaded with a working
 * session made nine API calls, all 200, and no 401 at all.
 *
 * THE RULES, and exactly when each fires.
 *
 * Two of them apply only when the operator configured a storage state, because only then has
 * anyone asserted that this scan is signed in. Without that assertion a 401 and a login form are
 * ordinary things for a signed-out visitor to meet, and firing on them would turn every deliberate
 * signed-out scan into a coverage gap.
 *
 * Rule A, refused data requests. Fires when a storage state is configured AND at least one of the
 *   page's own fetch or XHR requests to the application's own hostname had answered 401 at either
 *   of two reads: the first when readiness settles, the second after the walk, the checks, the
 *   source attachment, and the reachability measurement have run. A refusal that arrives after the
 *   second read is not seen. Nothing overrides it.
 *
 *   The application's hostname, not any host. An optional widget, an analytics beacon, or a
 *   third-party service whose own credentials are stale can answer 401 while the application
 *   session is perfectly good, and discarding a whole screen every run over that is not a cost
 *   worth paying. A refusal from the application's own API is the application saying it does not
 *   accept this session. See refusalsFromAppHost for the match and why an unreadable appBaseUrl
 *   counts everything.
 *
 *   Two reads, not one, and not a continuous watch. It is NOT free of a timing race. Readiness
 *   needs four equal DOM counts 500 ms apart plus 500 ms of network quiet, so a stable shell
 *   settles in about 1.5 s, and an application that sends its identity request later than that has
 *   sent nothing yet when the first read happens. Measured with the real adapter: a page fetching
 *   its identity endpoint at three seconds recorded nothing at the first read and the 401 during
 *   the walk window. The second read closes that window, and it deliberately includes traffic the
 *   providers caused, because a request a provider click triggered is still the application
 *   answering this session.
 *
 *   One boundary remains, and it cannot be closed from here: a 401 that arrives after the second
 *   read is not seen. That read is the last observation of the page before it is closed, so a
 *   response still in flight at that moment is never recorded.
 *
 *   401 only. 403 means authenticated and not permitted, which is a state a correctly signed-in
 *   scan can legitimately meet.
 *
 * Rule B, a password field anywhere. Fires when a storage state is configured AND at least one
 *   password input exists anywhere in the page: any frame, and inside open shadow roots. The
 *   address is not consulted, because the application that produced this defect never changes it.
 *   A signed-in session has no business being shown a password field.
 *
 *   Overridden by reachedWhen. When the surface declares a reachedWhen selector and that selector
 *   is present at the time of the check, this rule does not fire. The operator has made a positive
 *   assertion that this screen rendered, and that outranks a heuristic that it did not. A
 *   change-password screen, or a settings page with a re-authentication prompt, is exactly the
 *   case the override exists for: a real signed-in screen that really does contain a password
 *   field, which would otherwise be discarded on every run with no way to say so.
 *
 *   reachedWhen is operator-supplied policy, not independent proof. A selector that matches a
 *   persistent application shell, a header, a navigation, or a footer is present on a login wall
 *   too, and it will let Rule B pass the wrong page. To be worth anything it has to name content
 *   only this screen has: that screen's own table, its own heading, its own empty state.
 *
 *   The override does not extend to Rule A, for the same reason. A same-host 401 with a configured
 *   session is the application itself saying the session was refused, which is stronger evidence
 *   than any selector an operator wrote.
 *
 * Rule C, redirected to a login page. Fires whether or not a storage state is configured, when the
 *   address the browser ended on differs from the one requested AND a password field is present.
 *   With no session configured this is still the wrong page: usabl was asked to measure one screen
 *   and measured another. With a session configured Rule B already covers it, so in practice this
 *   is the signed-out rule.
 *
 * Address comparison for Rule C normalizes scheme case, host case, default port, and one trailing
 * slash on the path. The query string is ignored, because a login redirect usually adds a return
 * address and a legitimately requested login screen often has one too, so a query difference
 * separates nothing. The fragment IS compared, because hash routers keep the whole route there and
 * ignoring it would leave every hash-routed application uncovered by Rule C.
 *
 * FALSE POSITIVES, which this can produce.
 *
 * Rule A fires on a refused same-host request even when the application session is fine, such as
 * an optional feature on the application's own API that this identity is not entitled to and whose
 * server answers 401 rather than 403, and it fires on every page-initiated 401 when appBaseUrl
 * cannot be parsed. Rule B fires on a signed-in screen that really does contain a password field
 * and declares no reachedWhen. Rule C fires on a screen reached at a different
 * path or fragment than the one configured that also shows a password field, which in practice is
 * a stale configured URL. In all three the cost is a coverage gap, so the run reports not_covered
 * rather than a verdict, and the fix is to correct the surface URL or to declare a reachedWhen
 * selector for that screen.
 *
 * FALSE NEGATIVES, which matter more and are real.
 *
 * A server-rendered login page that makes no API calls and carries no password input is not caught
 * by any rule here: a passkey prompt, a magic-link page, an email-first identity provider, or a
 * consent screen. An authentication wall that answers 200 to everything and renders a branded
 * landing page is not caught either. A login page served at the very address that was requested,
 * with no session configured, cannot be told from the screen itself. A sign-in wall whose API
 * lives on an unrelated hostname is not caught by Rule A, and neither is a 401 that arrives after
 * the second read. Rule B passes a wrong page whenever the surface declares a reachedWhen selector
 * that a login wall also matches, which any shell, header, navigation, or footer selector does.
 * The body-only detector in
 * coverage/unseen.ts catches the subset of these that render nothing focusable; the rest stay open.
 * A miss leaves the behaviour that was there before, so it never manufactures a new false green,
 * and the reachedWhen selector on a surface is the operator's positive assertion for a screen where
 * these heuristics are not enough.
 *
 * This unit reports coverage. It must never mint a verdict.

 * with a paid-down entry:
 *
 *   - a different port, because a scan target and its API can sit on different ports of one host;
 *   - a different scheme, because a page served over https can call an http endpoint, or the
 *     reverse in a lab;
 *   - an API subdomain, because `api.example.com` serving `example.com` is the ordinary shape.
 *
 * So a refused request counts when its hostname equals the `appBaseUrl` hostname, or ends with a
 * dot followed by it. Scheme and port are ignored. `api.example.com` counts for `example.com`;
 * `notexample.com` does not, because the dot is required.
 *
 * When `appBaseUrl` does not parse there is no hostname to compare against, and then EVERY
 * page-initiated 401 counts. That is the opposite of the earlier behaviour and it is deliberate.
 * This product fails toward disclosure: a base URL usabl cannot read is a configuration usabl
 * cannot reason about, and reporting not_covered on such a run is the honest outcome, where
 * counting nothing would quietly hand back a verdict. A refused address that will not parse counts
 * for the same reason: it is still a request the page made and the server refused.
