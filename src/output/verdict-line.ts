/**
 * The one verdict line every surface opens with.
 *
 * Reads a Result and names its state: a symbol, the verdict word, the exit code, and one plain
 * sentence saying what the state means for the change. Every surface that presents a verdict
 * starts from this unit so the terminal report, the stop hook, and the self-check cannot drift
 * apart on the words a reader sees first.
 *
 * This unit never mints a verdict. It reads `verdict` and `exitCode` as the gate wrote them.
 *
 * The symbol is decoration. The word and the exit code carry the meaning, so a reader who cannot
 * see the symbol, or a screen reader that names it oddly, loses nothing. No colour is used, so
 * no state depends on colour to be understood.
