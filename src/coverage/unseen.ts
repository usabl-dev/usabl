/**
 * Unseen-screen detection: which scanned screens the engine has no grounds to claim it measured.
 *
 * A scan can finish without an error and still never have reached the application. An
 * unauthenticated route, a component that threw on mount, and a wrong URL all settle into a
 * stable document with nothing in it, and axe then fires the same few document-level rules on
 * every one of them. Readiness cannot separate those cases from a legitimately empty list,
 * because all four settle, so the split is made here from what the scan actually returned.
 *
 * Reachability rests on positive evidence that a screen rendered, never on absence of difference
 * between screens. Two screens that measured identically at different URLs are not proof of a blank
 * page: a templated route, a shared application shell, and two pages that carry the same barrier all
 * produce identical findings while rendering correctly. Equality of what we did not find is not
 * evidence of unreachability, so this unit does not infer from it.
 *
 * Two detectors run, both positive observations about one screen:
 *   1. isBodyOnly reads the keyboard transcript. Every stop stayed on the document body, so the page
 *      had nothing to walk. This is the sound floor and runs for every screen.
 *      A body-only screen is unseen even if reachedWhen matched, because a selector aimed at a
 *      persistent app shell matches on a login wall too.
 *   2. reachedSelectorPresent reads a per-surface assertion the operator declared and the scan
 *      measured against the live DOM. Only an explicit false (declared and absent) marks a screen
 *      unseen. A true value only suppresses its own reachedWhen gap; it never cancels the body-only
 *      floor. The two detectors are independent.
 *
 * The findings are dropped, not downgraded. The gate weighs a new failure before it weighs
 * missing coverage on purpose, because a real new barrier is the actionable answer. Leaving
 * these drafts in place with a gap beside them would still mint regression from a document
 * nobody rendered.
 *
 * There is no element-count threshold here. A blank screen of a real application still carries
 * a few hundred head elements, so a count would only be another number to tune.
 *
 * This unit reports coverage. It must never mint a verdict.
