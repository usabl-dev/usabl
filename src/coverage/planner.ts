 * Refuses any screen id that could stand for more than one screen.

 * Three sources mint screen ids and all three land in the same identity space: operator surfaces,
 * discovered routes, and docs manifest pages. App coverage and docs coverage are concatenated by
 * the caller, and downstream the id alone keys floor identity, finding identity, waiver matching,
 * applicability, and source lookup. So one id shared by two screens does not merely drop a screen
 * from the scan. It also lets a floor entry belonging to one screen absorb a genuinely new barrier
 * on the other, which reads as carried debt and mints a verified receipt over a real failure.
 * Each source checks itself for duplicates. Nothing checked across them until here.
 *
 * A surface and a discovered route may share an id, because that is how a surface overrides the
 * scan url for a screen discovery already owns. usabl does not try to work out whether a given
 * pair is that override or two different screens. It cannot: a url does not determine a screen.
 * Applications select screens by query, fragment, trailing slash, and userinfo, servers do not
 * treat percent spellings as interchangeable, and a redirect can send two requests for one url to
 * two different screens depending on session, server state, or time. Even exact string equality
 * proves only that the same address was requested. So the config declares the relationship with
 * `overridesDiscoveredRoute` and nothing is inferred from the url at all.
 *
 * No such declaration exists for docs pages, because a docs page is never an alias for an app
 * screen, so any overlap involving a docs page is refused outright.
